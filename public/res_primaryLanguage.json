I am interested in a role as a software developer because I have gained an expertise in IT project management, writing use cases, and documenting requirements for software with the King County Sheriff.  I have worked hard to complement these skills by learning to code in an accelerated bootcamp and I am excited to continue my career where I help people every day. Something interesting that I just fixed at work is our crime map, which provides statistics on incidents in their neighborhoods, while working closely with our vendor City Protect.",
