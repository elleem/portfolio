Hi! I'm Lauren! <br>
I am software developer with a background in project management and IT analysis. <br>
For the last six years, I have worked in public safety, with the King County Sheriff's Office Computer Resource Unit. I have gained expertise in IT project management, writing use cases, documenting software requirements, and user support.  <br>
Something interesting that I just fixed at work is the King County crime map, which provides statistics on incidents throughout the County. Working closely with our vendor City Protect, I coordinated the backfill of our third-party API. <br>
